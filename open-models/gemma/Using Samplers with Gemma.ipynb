Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.  This tutorial uses KerasNLP, a collection of natural language processing (NLP) models implemented in [Keras](https://keras.io/) and runnable on JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.\n",
